I can see you over there staring at your drink
Watchin' that ice sink all alone tonight
And chances are you're sittin' here in this bar
'Cause he ain't gonna treat you right

Well, it's probably not my place
But I'm gonna say it anyway
'Cause you look like
You haven't felt the fire had a little fun
Hadn't had a smile in a little while, baby

Blue looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall
But darling, it don't match your eyes
I'm tellin' you, you don't need that guy
It's so black and white, he's stealin' your thunder
Baby, blue ain't your color

I'm not tryna be another, just pick you up
Kinda guy tryna drink you up, tryna take you home
But I just don't understand how another man
Can take your sun and turn it ice-cold

Well, I've had enough to drink
And it's makin' me think that I just might
Tell you if I were a painter, I wouldn't change you
I'd just paint you bright, baby

'Cause blue looks good on the sky, mhm
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall
But darling, it don't match your eyes
I'm tellin' you, you don't need that guy
It's so black and white, he's stealin' your thunder
Baby, blue ain't your color, no-no-no

It ain't your color, baby
Mhm, baby

Blue looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin' on the wall
But darling, it don't match your eyes
I'm tellin' you, you don't need that guy
It's so black and white, he's stealin' your thunder
Baby, blue ain't your color

Blue ain't your color
Mhm, oh no-no, baby
Come here, baby
Let me light up your world
